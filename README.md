# Cryptocurrencies

This project is to use unsupervised machine learning to examine crryptocurrency data.
The data we used to work on is not ideal so its needed to be processed to fit the machine learning.  we use unsupervised learing becouse the output is unknown.

# Results:
  * Clustering  Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means:
